- this code reads parameters from config file or commandline interface
- unfortunately it doesn't construct and print the usage/help of the
  command line params

https://youtu.be/6dXb4oF1rZA dependency injection seems nice (to pass logger around)

- I find the command line parsing provided by
  Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.CommandLine severely lacking. I
  would like to have automatic generation of the usage message and
  support for boolean flags without explicitly writing true or false
  on the command line.
